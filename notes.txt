when demoing stuff, maybe it would be distracting if users could walk in front of others


There are many diffeent ways to communicate over websockets.
JSON is less efficient than datagrams, yes.

I'm using ChatGPT for drafting, so there's going to be some weirdness in the code.
I'd like to make all my real source code freely available on the internet, but no.

I'm mostly re-doing stuff i've already made, but I don't want to necessarily remake eveerything.


TODO:
initial installation should also copy the AFRAME dist files into 'public'
ports being referenced in server.js et al should be encapsulated in a consts file

ChatGPT bugs are astonishingly esoteric.
The websocket takes an unusual time to fire an onopen event, everything is so slow.
I know there are some optimizations I'm missing, maybe they're worth sharing.
